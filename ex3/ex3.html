		<p> Hello, my name is Karl, and I am a dwarf. I work for Deep Rock Galactic, and my job is to shoot bugs and mine.<br>
            I work with a team and serve as the role of scout. Which essentially means I make the entire operation possible. <br>
            Need some light in a large cavern? That's me. See some minerals in a spot you can't reach? Also me. Need one <br>
            dwarf to stay alive and make sure the whole team doesn't wake up in the medbay? That is most certainly me.<br>
            I'm fast, I'm reliable, and you bet your beard I'll always find a bug to call Steve. Rock and Stone! </p> <br>
